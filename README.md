<img width="125" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/CyberSpeedway-JapaneseSoundtrackPatchSaturn/blob/main/cover.png?raw=true" align="right">A patch to restore the Japanese soundtrack on the NTSC-U version of the Sega Saturn game "Cyber Speedway". 
<br><br>
This patch restores the soundtrack composed by <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/454759/koji-hayama/">Kouji Hayama</a> from the original Japanese version of the game (entitled "Gran Chaser"). The official North American release replaced Hayama's music with works by the band <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/3418924-Bygone-Dogs">Bygone Dogs</a>.
<br><br>
Note that the PAL release used the original soundtrack from Hayama, but is heavily optimized for 50hz. When played at 60hz, the bottom portion of the screen is cut off. Additionally, there may be other issues when playing the PAL version at 60hz, though they aren't documented.
